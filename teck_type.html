            <h2>Lets learn how our would works.</h2>
            <p>We know that <a href="what_is_tech.html">technology</a> is a broad term incorporating most things in <a href="interwined.html">our lives.</a> Let's look at some of the major categories. As we will soon see some if not all of these seven categories overlap with each other in some way or another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agriculture and Bio-Technology: This is a branch of technology that focuses on Developing and advancing our understanding, procedures, systems, and tools we use to plant, grow, or alter crops or plant tissues. This category incorporates everything from growing crops to preventing pests from invading crops.</li>
                <li>Construction Technology focuses on growing and improving our procedures, techniques, and systems to help ease putting structures on the respective job sites where they will be used. Some recent advancement in this field is the process of manufacturing building structures or components off-site. This has lead to significantly shorter build times and drastically reduced waste produced and materials used at a job site.</li>
                <li>Information and Communication Technology focuses on advancing the way we gather, process, share information in distinct parts of the globe. A noteworthy innovation in this field is the use of fiberoptic cables used to transport information across the oceans and seas.</li>
                <li> Transportation Technology focuses on the development of vehicles, tools, and systems to move people or objects from one area to another. A noteworthy technological advancement in this field is the shipping container. Shipping containers streamlined loading transportation and minimized theft. They have drastically reduced the cost of transportation.</li>
                <li>Medical Technology focuses on developing and improving new technology to promote health and cure illnesses. Advancements in this field include prosthetics that a user can control with there mind or always-on glucose meters for diabetics.</li>
                <li>Energy Technology focuses on the development of devices and systems that help us convert, transmit, or process energy. Some recent advancements in the field include more efficient appliances that efficiently use less energy. There are also ever-improving power grids that are designed to better sustain a city from a power outage.</li>
                <li>Manufacturing Technology focuses on developing and using devices, systems, and processes to convert materials into products. This also encompasses material sciences such as paint that is so black that images taken of objects painted in it look like they were cropped. Or screen glass that is so strong it out muscle`s steel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technology has branched out and is rapidly improving. How exciting it is to <a href="tech_in_life.html">live in this era</a> of increased advancement. </p>
