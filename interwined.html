            <h2>The weak human</h2>
            <p>After realizing how intertwined we are with technology a good question spring to mind. In what ways is <a href="what_is_tech.html">technology</a> not influencing our lives. I feel to truly get away from technology you have to go deep into the woods. Even there are you not really disconnected to it. You are if wearing cloths your definitely still using it, you are still using it if you are using tools to make a fire or a lever to move a stone or constructing a tent. You are using technology. Therefore I think technology is part of the <a href="tech_in_life.html">human experience.</a></p>

            <p>Compared to other spices humans are pretty unremarkable. We are not that strong when compared to a Rino, not that fast, as most animals can our run us. Our stomachs are pathetically weak and we would suffer if we drink water from a river as most animals do. The list goes on and on. What makes us remarkable is our brain, the <a href="teck_type.html">tools</a>, and the critical thinking we do is what makes us special. So be default technology makes us special.</p>
