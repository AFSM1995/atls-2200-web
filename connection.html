            <p>I have had a <a href="tech_in_life.html">strong connection</a> and reliance to technology throughout my entire life. I donâ€™t think anyone living in the US in the 21st century can say that technology has not <a href="interwined.html">impacted</a> them in some way or another. </p>

            <p>While there is still more to say on this topic. I feel like this is a great talking point for this assignment. <a href="what_is_tech.html">Technology</a> is very human. It is hard to get away for it and it should not be easy for it to control us. I feel like we are on the right track. I am more than excited to see what human innovation and creativity have in store for us. It has made our lives so much easier I can only imagine how easy and enjoyable the future will be.
