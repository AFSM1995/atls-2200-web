            <h2>The Not So Humble Addiction</h2>
            <p>I would argue that although <a href="tech_in_life.html">screen addiction</a> is a problem, it is not a major problem. Sure it is annoying seeing so many people enslaved to there phones or headphones but people have the right to use there time as they wish. This leads me to point something out thatâ€™s nefarious and so discreetly hidden from us. That is that phones are made to be addictive. App developers and companies spend a lot of time in making sure that your attention is spent on their platform. They have sneaky ways to do this too. Social media sites have an infinite scroll that makes it hard to set a definitive stop. Apps and applications are also very colorful. This is a very good tactic as colorful and bright colors are rare in nature.</p>

            <p>Developers also use notifications to remind you to <a href="connection.html">revisit there app.</a> They also make sure there is always something for you too look at on there app or site. They track your activity and feed to see what you do on your app, how you do it and why you do it. They try to learn as much about you as possible while at the same time making there app <a href="tips.html">easy to use.</a> This is only scratching the surface, of course, the number of tactics these content providers use is plentiful.</p>
