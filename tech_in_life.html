            <h2>Living with Tech.</h2>
            <p><a href="what_is_tech.html">Technology</a> is such a broad term that some people donâ€™t know that they are <a href="interwined.html">partaking</a> in technology. When someone thinks about technology most people think about computers and phones and screens with lines of text scrolling through them. The reality is that technology <a href="teck_type.html">encompasses a lot more than that.</a> Let's look at some of those.</p>

            <p>Technology is everywhere and impacts every aspect of my life. I wake up in the morning to a cell phone alarm and get up from my engineered mattress and cotton/polyester sheets and dress myself with cloths that have drastically improved over the century as new innovations in material science change what they are made of. I then eat and shower using technology. Some of that tech is old; 200 years plus. Some of that technology has only been around for a couple of years. I then drive to school in a car, park in a garage designed to accommodate as many cars as possible as cheaply as possible. After that is done I start the day.</p>
