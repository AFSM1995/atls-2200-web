            <h2>The Not So Humble Smart Phone</h2>
            <p>Its good to note that all of the changes technology has brought us are good things. Like everything, <a href="culture_change_present.html">cell phones</a> have they're a downside. One of the biggest negative cultural changes I have seen as a result of <a href="culture_change_past.html">cars</a> is pollution. As far as phones are concerned I would say that its the undivided attention that people give to there cell phones.</p>

            <p>Anywhere you walk you see someone on their phone hooked on to there screen. Their attention to the funny cat video or recent post a friend made is focused and oblivious to the rest of the world. We are living in a zombie focused world were people if they have free time will look down and gaze at there screen. A society where if you can spare a second, it's spent on a cell phone screen.</p>

            <p>People are free to use there time as they wish but I think it's clear that people may have a slight problem. Some people, it seems like, will have <a href="creating_addiction.html">mental breakdowns</a> without there devices. This is so common spread that you can not go a day without seeing someone walking and looking at there phone. Phone addiction has been categorized as a mental disorder. Smartphone addiction has an official term “nomophobia” Its fueled by a simple overuse problem which leads to an addiction disorder.</p>
