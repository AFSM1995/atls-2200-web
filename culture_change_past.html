            <h2>The Humble Car</h2>
            <p>I do believe that technology is culture changing. Without a doubt, it has made our lives easier and freed up time that we can now use to <a href="tech_in_life.html">pursue pleasures</a> instead of necessities. <a href="interwined.html">Back in the good old days</a> doing your laundry took 4 to 8 hours and was very physically involved. That's, not the case anymore. This is thanks mainly to the technological marvel that is the humble washing machine.</p>

            <p>Let's look at another great technological invention, the car. When diving became big in America massive highways popped up that connected distant cites and unventured terrains. As a result, the culture of transportation drastically changed from a mostly train and horse buggy driven transportation system to a car driven transportation system. Cars allowed for people to get somewhere independently and faster. This helped connect people that would normally be out of reach. Cars brought on weekend drives, changed family lives, the economy, and the environment. They completely changed the possibilities of most Americans. Cars changed the culture so much that they are responsible for making the suburbs a possibility. That alone a huge cultural change.</p>

            <p>Technology is more than capable of completely changing how and what people can do in a short amount of time. <a href="culture_change_present.html">Crazy stuff.</a></p>
