            <h2>The Not So Humble Smart Phone</h2>
            <p>Today technology is <a href="culture_change_past.html">still</a> changing culture, not just in the U.S but across the world. What is the technological marvel of the 21 century? I would argue that the biggest innovation to date is the smartphone. Smartphones have absorved many older forms of technology. They have and are changing current cultural habits. They uncountably have <a href="tips.html">affected all of us</a> in some way or another.

                <p>The smartphone has changed how you wake up. The way you call a cab, the way you read the newspaper. The way you watch tv. The way you play games. The way you listen to music. The way you shop The way you date. The way you bank The way you socialize. The way you order food. The way you review restaurants. The way you do schoolwork. The way you look at your email. The way you track your health. The type of assignment that you have to do. As you might have guessed I can go on and on.</p>

                <p>Each one of these mentioned things alone is a huge cultural change to just the way we did thing ten years ago. Cell phones were an optional luxury ten years ago. <a href="tech_in_life.html">Today they are a necessity.</a> They have become an instrumental tool in our lives. They have made our lives easy and more efficient. Yet there is no dought that they like all of us, have a dark side.</p>
