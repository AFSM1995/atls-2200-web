            <h2>Lets ask some hard questions.</h2>
            <p>Do you feel like there is a little too much <a href="what_is_tech.html">technology</a> in your life? Or do you feel that you have developed a slight addiction? Maybe you would like a cure for your troubles? Well, you're in luck I will present you with some tipis on protecting yourself from these <a href="addiction.html">addictive</a> apps and <a href="creating_addiction.html">practices.</a> Below are some good ways to fight the man.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tip 1: Disable all notification for noncritical applications, as these are distractive traps with a goal to keep your attention.</li>
                <li>Tip 2: Delete useless apps that provide little to your life. This is simple if it's not there it won't distract you.</li>
                <li>Tip 3: Reduce the severity of notifications. You donâ€™t need an alert every time an artist puts out a new song.</li>
                <li>Tip 4: Hide distracting apps in folders far out of reach, or better yet delete then if they only provide a distraction to you.</li>
                <li>Tip 5: Turn on gray mode to reduce the color and therefore the attractiveness of your phone and apps.</li>
                <li>Tip 6: Make your phone boring, keep only productive apps on there. This means no games or social media. This removes the phone from your list of entertainment sources.</li>
                <li>Tip 7: make your phone as minimalistic as possible by disabling unnecessary widgets and plugins that complicate your experience.</li>
                <li>Tip 8: To protect your privacy walk through every menu in the settings of your phone to disable sharing and app permissions.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>While there is definitely more that you can do and you certainly don't have to do all of this. I feel like this a <a href="addiction.html">good way to start</a> if you so do wish.</p>
